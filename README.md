- 🤍 I love making things, executing ideas to fruition, and working on projects.
- 🌱 I am currently dedicating my free time to learning **Kotlin** and **Java** for **Android development**.
- 🎯 My goal is to become a skilled **software engineer**, with a strong focus on **mobile development**.
- 🎮 I also have a side interest for **game development** and **engine tooling**, especially when utilizing **Godot**. This has led me to explore lower-level languages such as **C++** and **C#**, and to develop a deeper understanding of **backend systems**.
- 🖳 Growing up immersed in the internet, I also became familiar with **basic web development**, working with tools like **HTML** and **CSS**.
